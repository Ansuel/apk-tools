# NAME

apk upgrade - upgrade installed packages

# SYNOPSIS

*apk upgrade* [<_options_>...]

# DESCRIPTION

*apk upgrade* upgrades installed packages to the latest version available from
configured package repositories (see *apk-repositories*(5)).

# OPTIONS

## COMMIT OPTIONS

*apk upgrade* commits the database, and supports the same options as other
commit operations.

*-s, --simulate*
	Simulate the requested operation without making any changes.

*--clean-protected*
	Do not create .apk-new files in configuration directories.

*--overlay-from-stdin*
	Read list of overlay files from stdin.

*--no-scripts*
	Do not execute any scripts.

*--no-commit-hooks*
	Skip pre/post hook scripts (but not other scripts).

*--initramfs-diskless-boot*
	Enables options for diskless initramfs boot (e.g. skip hooks).

## UPGRADE OPTIONS

The following options affect the *upgrade* operation.

*-a, --available*
	Resets version constraints in _world_ (see *apk-world*(5)) and prefers
	replacing or downgrading packages if the currently installed package is
	no longer available from any repository (instead of holding them).

*-l, --latest*
	Disables normal heuristics for choosing which repository to install a
	package from, preferring only repositories from which the latest
	version is available. This has no effect on pinned packages.

*--no-self-upgrade*
	Do not do an early upgrade of the 'apk-tools' package.

*--self-upgrade-only*
	Only perform a self-upgrade of the 'apk-tools' package.
