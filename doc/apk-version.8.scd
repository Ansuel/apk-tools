apk-version(8)

# NAME

apk version - compare package versions

# SYNOPSIS

*apk version* [<_options_>...] [_packages_...]

*apk version* -c _versions_...

*apk version* -t _left_ _right_

*apk version* -I

# DESCRIPTION

*apk version* compares the versions of installed packages against package
versions available from repositories (see *apk-repositories*(5)). If no
packages are specified, all installed packages are considered.  Otherwise,
the comparison is limited to the explicitly listed packages. A summary is
printed on stdout, with the difference between package versions being
represented as *>*, *=*, or *<*.

*apk version -c* tests the specified version string(s) for validity and prints
a list of _invalid_ version strings. If all version strings are valid, nothing
is printed and *apk version* exits with status code zero. If one or more
version strings are invalid, the exit code is nonzero.

*apk version -t* accepts two arbitrary version strings and compares them
without consulting the database, then prints the result as *>*, *=*, or *<*.

*apk version -I* prints the versions and descriptions of each repository's
index. See *apk-repositories*(5) for more information.

# OPTIONS

These options only apply when checking installed package versions against
packages available from the repositories (when neither *-c*, *-t*, nor *-I* are
specified).

*-a*
	Consider packages from all repository tags.

*-l* _operand_
	Limit output to packages whose comparison is among the given operands,
	specified as any combination of *>*, *=*, and *<*.
